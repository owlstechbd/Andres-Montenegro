            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">A. What is your primary research interest?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">My primary research interest is direct feedback as a driver of resilience
                    in leadership. My big picture vision is to make direct feedback a normalized leadership
                    practice—without filters, without euphemisms, and without sugarcoating. I believe everyone, not just
                    current leaders, but coworkers and future leaders too, should be developed through direct, honest
                    input. Feedback should not be labeled positive or negative; it should just be feedback—direct,
                    clear, actionable. When a person does something, good or bad, they should receive feedback. That's
                    how people grow. That's how leaders are forged. Even when someone wins or performs excellently, they
                    still deserve feedback—on what to do next, how to go further, and where the next stretch of
                    development lies. Direct feedback challenges the ego, builds emotional strength, and supports
                    long-term resilience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">B. What is the research problem you are addressing?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">We have built a professional culture—especially over the last decade—that
                    avoids directness. We tiptoe around problems. We protect people's feelings instead of their
                    development. In doing so, we have weakened our organizations. I see too many people afraid to say
                    the truth when something is wrong, and afraid to hear it when they have made a mistake. I want to
                    study this fear of directness. I want to uncover what we have lost by abandoning feedback as a tool
                    for growth, and I want to document how leaders can recover that strength—by embracing feedback not
                    as insult, but as insight. That's the heart of my research problem.</p>

        <div class="Research-section" id="ConceptualFramework">
            <h2 class="Research-subheading">Section 2: Conceptual Framework</h2>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">A. What are some important ideas, concepts, or theories that inform your
                    study?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">The most important concepts informing my study are direct feedback,
                    psychological safety, and emotional intelligence. These three pillars form the lens through which I
                    see leadership development and resilience building. Emotional intelligence helps leaders regulate
                    and interpret the discomfort that comes with feedback. Psychological safety determines whether
                    feedback is delivered and received in a productive way. And direct feedback, in itself, is the
                    mechanism that activates growth. These concepts are not abstract for me—they are active forces in
                    how real leaders become stronger in real environments.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">B. What are some important theorists and researchers whose work has informed
                    your study?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">Goleman's work on emotional intelligence helps me understand how leaders
                    absorb feedback. Edmondson's research on psychological safety explains why some environments allow
                    growth while others suppress it. And the grounded theory methods of Charmaz guide how I build a
                    model from participants' experiences. These scholars helped me take what I have witnessed in the
                    real world and see it as something that can be analyzed, explained, and eventually taught.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">C. What ideas from theory and research have helped you clarify your own
                    understanding of your study?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">One big idea I have taken from theory is that leaders do not grow from
                    praise—they grow from friction, discomfort, and insight. That only happens through real feedback.
                    I've learned that emotion and environment are just as important as the words being spoken. Without
                    safety and intelligence, feedback can harm instead of help. This realization helped me clarify why
                    direct feedback, given correctly, is a force for good in leadership development.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">D. What questions still remain for you?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">I want to know why so many leaders avoid giving direct feedback. I want to
                    know what cultural or emotional block stops people from telling the truth at work. And I want to
                    understand how leaders bounce back from the pain of direct feedback and use that pain to build
                    strength. These are the unanswered questions that keep me curious.</p>

        <div class="Research-section" id="ResearchQuestions">
            <h2 class="Research-subheading">Section 3: Research Questions</h2>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">A. What do you want to learn from your study?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">I want to understand what stops people from giving or receiving direct
                    feedback in leadership environments. I want to learn what kind of feedback builds resilience, what
                    conditions make it work, and how emotional intelligence and psychological safety shape the feedback
                    experience. I also want to see what is possible when we stop filtering our words and instead speak
                    truthfully to one another with respect. I want to document how this directness leads to better
                    leadership.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">B. Why do you want to learn this?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">I want to learn this because I believe we are losing our ability to help
                    one another grow. We have built what I call a house of glass—where nobody wants to say anything real
                    because they are afraid of causing offense. In doing that, we are preventing growth, especially in
                    leadership. I believe feedback does not need to be labeled positive or negative—it just needs to be
                    direct. I know others feel the same, but they are afraid to say it. My study gives voice to that
                    silent group and helps restore feedback as a tool for growth.</p>

        <div class="Research-section" id="ResearchRelationships">
            <h2 class="Research-subheading">Section 4: Research Relationships</h2>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">A. What relationships do you have with the people you plan to study?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">I do not have personal relationships with the people I want to participate
                    with in the future. I have intentionally avoided close friends or colleagues to avoid bias or
                    pressure. The people I have approached are mostly professional acquaintances that I connected with
                    through networks. This distance is by design—I want their responses to be honest, not polite.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">B. How will you establish a learning relationship with your participants?
                </h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">I will establish relationships by emphasizing anonymity, trust, and
                    simplicity. I tell participants that I am not looking for fancy answers—I want truth. I let them
                    know that I respect their privacy and will not ask for names, titles, or affiliations. I've found
                    that this opens up space for people to be more real. I approach the relationship not as a scholar
                    judging them, but as a peer who values their lived experience.</p>

            <h2 class="Research-subheading">Section 5: Site and Participation Selection</h2>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">A. Where do you plan to conduct your research?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">There is no specific physical site. All data will be collected
                    anonymously, through emailed documents or shared forms. Because the people I am speaking with work
                    in sensitive fields—including government and military—we avoid identifying locations or
                    organizations. The site, if we can call it that, is a secure digital exchange of ideas.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">B. How and why have you chosen this site or participants?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">I will choose participants with significant professional experience—many
                    have worked in or around government, foreign service, or military. These individuals operate in
                    high-pressure, high-responsibility roles where feedback is often limited or filtered. I have also
                    made a point to include women with senior leadership experience, to see how gender influences the
                    feedback experience. My one challenge is that most participants are over 35, so I am now working to
                    include younger voices as well—ideally aged 20–25—to broaden the generational scope of the study.

            <h2 class="Research-subheading">Section 6: Data Collection</h2>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">A. How will you collect your data?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">I will collect data through written, anonymous interviews. Participants
                    receive a Microsoft Word document with a short explanation and ten open-ended questions. They
                    respond in writing and return it through email or a private form. I choose this method because it's
                    simple, secure, and works well with people who cannot share identifying information. Many of my
                    participants work in government or sensitive environments, so anonymity is essential. This approach
                    respects their confidentiality and allows for honest responses.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">B. Why is this method the best one to answer your research questions?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">This method works because it is practical and respectful. I did not want
                    to create a complicated research process—life is already complex, and I needed a system that is
                    sustainable. Collecting data through simple Word documents removes pressure from participants,
                    especially when they are used to dealing with confidentiality. It allows them to reflect before
                    answering. The stories they're sharing are full of emotional weight, and this approach gives them
                    the space to speak freely without fear or formality.</p>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">A. How will you analyze your data?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">I will read each interview response closely, line by line, and start
                    labeling patterns and phrases that show meaning—this is called open coding. From there, I will group
                    those codes into larger themes and see how different ideas connect—this is focused coding. Finally,
                    I will look at all the pieces and ask myself, "What is the big idea here?"—this leads to a central
                    theory or model. I am using grounded theory methods from Charmaz, which allows me to find meaning
                    based on what people actually say, not based on what I expect to find.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">B. Why is this method best suited to your study?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">It fits because I don't want to force my ideas onto the data. I want the
                    data to speak. People are telling real stories about leadership, fear, growth, and resilience. The
                    best way to honor their stories is to build meaning from their words. Grounded theory lets me build
                    from the ground up, rather than squeeze answers into a box. This also aligns with my goal to create
                    a usable model of how feedback shapes leadership in real-world environments.</p>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">A. What threats to validity do you foresee in your study?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">The biggest threat is over-interpreting or reading too much into people's
                    stories. Because the feedback experiences people share are emotional, it would be easy for me to
                    project my own views. Another issue is that some participants may hold back out of habit or fear,
                    even though the process is anonymous.</p>

            <div class="Research-subsection">
                <h3 class="Research-topic">B. What strategies and techniques will you use to ensure that your study is
                    trustworthy and valid?</h3>
                <p class="Research-paragraph">My strategy is to keep things simple. Sit down, read carefully, listen
                    deeply, and stay honest about what the data is showing. I will document my thoughts as I go so I can
                    track my thinking. If I am unsure, I will ask a peer to read through it with me. I want the analysis
                    to be clear, respectful, and useful. I agree with what Simon Sinek said once—if you make things too
                    complex, people stop listening. So I will keep the process real, human, and understandable.</p>
