                <h2>Dissertation Plan</h2>
                <p>The dissertation is centered around the theme of <span>Resilience Development in Leadership Through Direct Feedback,</span> focusing on how structured, purposeful feedback can serve as a transformative mechanism for developing leadership resilience across diverse contexts. Instead of isolating specific settings like military, corporate, or educational sectors, the study will target a more comprehensive range of organizational environments, emphasizing the commonality of feedback challenges regardless of industry or hierarchy.</p>

                <p>The objective is to examine how leaders can effectively utilize direct feedback to foster resilience, particularly in high-pressure and high-stakes situations. The study will delve into the importance of delivering feedback that is direct, respectful, and solution-oriented, ensuring that feedback is not only heard but also actionable. This includes creating structured frameworks that address the <span>problem, solution, practice, and follow-up,</span> allowing leaders and team members to internalize the feedback, work on improvements, and integrate the learning into their daily practices.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, the research will incorporate qualitative interviews with leaders and team members across various organizational contexts, gathering insights on how feedback is perceived, delivered, and acted upon. The aim is to identify patterns in feedback reception and to explore how cultural factors, such as direct communication styles, can influence the effectiveness of feedback. The overall purpose is to bridge the gap between theory and practice, establishing a universal feedback model that fosters growth, resilience, and accountability without unnecessary filters or softening of critical messages.</p>

                            <p>Resilience serves as the foundational pillar, emphasizing the ability to recover from setbacks and use feedback constructively. The literature highlights that resilience is cultivated not only through positive reinforcement but through direct, solution-focused feedback that encourages adaptive thinking (Brendtro, 2019).</p>

                            <p>Establishing a safe environment where direct feedback can be openly discussed without fear of reprisal is crucial. Leaders must cultivate a climate where critical insights are viewed as opportunities for growth, rather than personal attacks (Gichuhi, 2021). This includes encouraging open dialogue and establishing norms that frame feedback as a developmental tool rather than a punitive measure.</p>

                            <p>Feedback delivery is positioned as a structured, intentional process, focusing on problem identification, actionable solutions, practice, and follow-up. It is not just about pointing out errors but about creating a plan for correction, practicing the desired behavior, and revisiting the outcome. This aligns with Barry & McManigle (2021), who emphasize structured feedback as a mechanism for growth and continuous learning.</p>

                            <p>Collaborative leadership underscores the importance of involving peers in the feedback process to ensure that messages are clear, respectful, and solution-oriented. Before delivering feedback, leaders can consult with a trusted colleague to refine the message, ensuring that it is constructive and aligned with organizational values. This approach fosters a feedback culture that promotes shared responsibility and accountability.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">What strategies can be employed to integrate direct feedback as a routine practice in leadership development without compromising psychological safety?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Integrating direct feedback into leadership development requires a delicate balance to ensure psychological safety. Strategies include establishing a culture of trust and openness, where feedback is seen as a tool for growth rather than criticism. Regular, informal check-ins can normalize feedback, making it less daunting. Using a structured feedback model, such as the SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) model, can help deliver feedback objectively and constructively. Additionally, leaders should model vulnerability by sharing their own development areas and seeking feedback, fostering a reciprocal feedback environment.

                <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How can leaders effectively balance the delivery of constructive criticism with the cultivation of trust and openness in high-stakes environments?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Leaders should emphasize intention and empathy when delivering constructive criticism. By framing feedback as a shared goal toward improvement and using clear, respectful communication, trust is maintained. Listening actively and acknowledging emotional responses also builds openness.

                <div class="faq-question">How can leaders manage resistance to feedback in environments where feedback culture is underdeveloped or non-existent?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    To manage resistance, leaders can start by modeling openness to feedback themselves, encouraging small and consistent feedback interactions, and celebrating when feedback leads to improvements. Educating teams on the benefits of feedback and creating safe spaces for expression are also key.

                <div class="faq-question">In what ways can leaders ensure that feedback is effectively implemented and not just acknowledged?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Leaders should follow up on feedback with action plans, track progress, and acknowledge improvements. Regularly revisiting the feedback and discussing outcomes in one-on-one or team meetings reinforces its value and shows commitment to development.
