                        <p>Understanding the value of discipline is essential to overcoming failure, and throughout my journey, I have faced more setbacks than successes. However, each loss became a stepping stone to growth, pushing me to become a better man by recognizing my weaknesses and taking immediate action to improve. Discipline became the foundation of who I am today.</p>

                        <p>My journey began in Costa Rica, where I dreamed of being different and striving for excellence. At the age of 21, I joined the French Foreign Legion, where I faced some of the most grueling physical and mental challenges of my life. Training in the unforgiving terrains of Africa and Europe, I learned the meaning of true resilience and developed a deeper sense of self-awareness that would shape my leadership style.</p>

                        <p>In 2012, after two years of relentless effort and perseverance, I joined the US Army. The 75th Ranger Regiment became a critical point in my development as a professional, providing me with the tools to refine my leadership skills and become more strategic in my decisions. The Regiment was a place where discipline, teamwork, and accountability were paramount, reinforcing the importance of self-awareness and responsibility in every action taken.</p>

                        <p>The ultimate test of my physical and mental limits came with the Lancero School, a program known for its extreme challenges. This experience pushed me beyond anything I had encountered before, both physically and mentally, solidifying my resolve to excel as a leader under the most intense conditions.</p>

                        <p>Throughout this journey, I learned three languages — English, French, and Spanish — entirely on my own, using discipline and self-study as my guides. Today, with almost 18 years of military experience behind me, I am stepping into a new chapter, determined to use what I have learned to empower others to become stronger, more adaptive leaders.</p>
