    <div class="Rationale-artifact">
        <h3 class="Rationale-subheading">Artifact 1: Amazing Son – Executive Summary & Rationale</h3>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
        This artifact captures the foundation of my leadership identity, rooted in personal transformation and values shaped through lived experience. While deeply personal, the narrative reveals how emotional intelligence, ethical awareness, and resilience have become cornerstones of my leadership in both professional and academic settings.</p>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>DEL Outcomes Demonstrated:</strong></p>
        <ul class="Rationale-list">
            <li class="Rationale-list-item"><strong>Outcome 4 (Leadership Development and Ethics):</strong> This artifact shows how my leadership was shaped through ethical modeling and life experience, not through formal power or title. It reflects how leaders grow by first developing character and then applying that growth in their work.</li>
            <li class="Rationale-list-item"><strong>Outcome 6 (Stewardship – Conserve, Generate, Transform):</strong> The narrative reflects how I conserve the ethical lessons learned from my mother and generate new leadership meaning by integrating those lessons into my leadership style. It also contributes to transformation by sharing that journey with others.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>Theoretical Foundations:</strong><br>
        This artifact is grounded in authentic leadership (Avolio & Gardner, 2005), where personal growth and integrity drive leadership actions. It also reflects transformational leadership (Bass & Riggio, 2006), in which inspiration and resilience influence others. These theories helped me name and apply the leadership values I developed through experience.</p>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>Connection to My Development:</strong><br>
        Writing and reflecting on this artifact helped me recognize that personal transformation can be a valid source of leadership development. It also allowed me to frame my story in a way that models growth and accountability—two traits I carry into my work with clients and teams.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Artifact 2 -->
    <div class="Rationale-artifact">
        <h3 class="Rationale-subheading">Artifact 2: Strategic Relational Leadership – Executive Summary & Rationale</h3>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
        This artifact demonstrates how I lead through trust, emotional intelligence, and feedback rather than authority or command. It shows how I apply relationship-centered leadership in complex consulting environments where influence, safety, and communication determine mission success.</p>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>DEL Outcomes Demonstrated:</strong></p>
        <ul class="Rationale-list">
            <li class="Rationale-list-item"><strong>Outcome 2 (Timely Judgment and Creative Action):</strong> In my work, I build buy-in through collaborative decision-making, clarity of communication, and the use of feedback loops. This outcome is demonstrated through systems I use to create alignment, implement strategy, and adapt under pressure.</li>
            <li class="Rationale-list-item"><strong>Outcome 4 (Leadership Development and Ethics):</strong> I model and teach others how to apply emotional intelligence, psychological safety, and feedback-driven improvement in team environments. My work helps shape ethical, high-trust teams who can operate in diverse and high-stakes settings.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>Theoretical Foundations:</strong><br>
        This artifact draws from psychological safety theory (Edmondson, 1999), which supports the importance of safe communication environments. It is also grounded in emotional intelligence (Goleman, 2020) and transformational leadership (Bass & Riggio, 2006), which together guide how I lead, debrief, and build relational equity with clients and collaborators.</p>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>Connection to My Development:</strong><br>
        This artifact reflects how my leadership evolved from being directive to being responsive and relationship-centered. It also represents the bridge between what I've studied academically and what I apply in the field. These strategies have improved my consulting effectiveness and created more resilient client outcomes.</p>

    <!-- Artifact 3 -->
    <div class="Rationale-artifact">
        <h3 class="Rationale-subheading">Artifact 3: Financial Leadership and Empowerment – Executive Summary & Rationale</h3>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
        This artifact explores how my personal journey in financial literacy and discipline has enhanced my professional leadership. It highlights how financial structure supports strategic decision-making, reduces stress, and strengthens ethical accountability in my consulting practice. This artifact connects personal improvement with organizational credibility.</p>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>DEL Outcomes Demonstrated:</strong></p>
        <ul class="Rationale-list">
            <li class="Rationale-list-item"><strong>Outcome 1 (Scanning and Learning Systems):</strong> This artifact shows how I created financial systems with mentors and advisors to identify risk, build stability, and stay adaptable. These systems serve as learning tools and promote situational awareness—key principles in environmental scanning and leadership sustainability.</li>
            <li class="Rationale-list-item"><strong>Outcome 3 (Reconfigure Assets for Sustainment):</strong> By managing financial processes and reviewing them with feedback, I've aligned tangible resources (budgets, planning tools) and intangible assets (trust, discipline) to support sustainable consulting performance and personal resilience.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>Theoretical Foundations:</strong><br>
        This work is influenced by the psychological capital model (Luthans et al., 2007), which frames resilience and self-efficacy as essential leadership traits. I also apply feedback systems theory (London & Smither, 2002), where honest review drives better performance. These theories helped me turn a past weakness into a strength through deliberate reflection and structured correction.</p>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>Connection to My Development:</strong><br>
        This artifact represents a breakthrough moment in my leadership journey. Financial empowerment has helped me lead with confidence and accountability. It demonstrates how long-term personal growth can directly impact ethical leadership, client trust, and strategic readiness.</p>

    <!-- Artifact 4 -->
    <div class="Rationale-artifact">
        <h3 class="Rationale-subheading">Artifact 4: Leadership Development and Talent Advancement – Executive Summary & Rationale</h3>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
        This artifact describes my commitment to developing others as leaders—not through control or hierarchy, but by creating space for growth, feedback, and accountability. It reflects how I invest in building high-performing teams and mentor individuals with leadership potential through real-world engagement.</p>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>DEL Outcomes Demonstrated:</strong></p>
        <ul class="Rationale-list">
            <li class="Rationale-list-item"><strong>Outcome 1 (Scanning, Learning, and Creativity):</strong> I identify team members' potential early and provide opportunities for growth through planning, collaboration, and leadership in action. I continuously adjust processes and expectations to help others learn and adapt in unpredictable environments.</li>
            <li class="Rationale-list-item"><strong>Outcome 4 (Leadership Development and Ethics):</strong> I apply scholar-practitioner strategies to lead with humility, emotional intelligence, and ethical consistency. My mentoring and feedback practices foster trust, inclusion, and shared leadership.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>Theoretical Foundations:</strong><br>
        This artifact draws from shared leadership and transformational leadership theory (Bass & Riggio, 2006), where the leader is responsible for developing capacity in others. It also includes psychological safety principles (Edmondson, 2018), which enable honest feedback and sustained learning. These frameworks guide how I build ethical, empowered teams in the field.</p>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>Connection to My Development:</strong><br>
        This artifact reflects a shift in how I view leadership—not as individual success, but as multiplying impact through others. I now measure my effectiveness by how others grow under my guidance. My academic training helped me articulate and strengthen what I was already doing intuitively.</p>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Artifact 5 -->
    <div class="Rationale-artifact">
        <h3 class="Rationale-subheading">Artifact 5: Strategic Adaptability and Continuous Learning in Leadership – Executive Summary & Rationale</h3>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>Purpose:</strong><br>
        This artifact highlights how adaptability, feedback, and continuous learning shape my identity as a consultant and scholar-practitioner. It demonstrates how I stay flexible in high-pressure environments, evolve with changing demands, and transform setbacks into leadership growth. It reflects my belief that learning is not a phase—it's a permanent trait of effective leadership.</p>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>DEL Outcomes Demonstrated:</strong></p>
        <ul class="Rationale-list">
            <li class="Rationale-list-item"><strong>Outcome 2 (Timely Judgment and Creative Action):</strong> I apply adaptive strategies to guide clients and teams through uncertainty, using feedback systems and situational awareness to respond effectively to complex challenges.</li>
            <li class="Rationale-list-item"><strong>Outcome 5 (Apply Research to Practice):</strong> I use academic research to guide real-time leadership decisions. My doctoral studies directly influence my fieldwork, shaping how I approach risk, team learning, and leader resilience.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>Theoretical Foundations:</strong><br>
        This artifact draws from adaptive leadership theory (Heifetz et al., 2009) and psychological capital theory (Luthans et al., 2007). These frameworks emphasize that resilience, reflection, and strategic learning are what enable leaders to stay effective in complexity. My systems for self-assessment and structured feedback are also supported by feedback culture theory (London & Smither, 2002).</p>
        
        <p class="Rationale-paragraph"><strong>Connection to My Development:</strong><br>
        This artifact brings together my academic and professional development. It shows that learning is no longer just for knowledge—it's for survival, relevance, and impact. This reflection has helped me understand that my role is not just to adapt but to help others adapt as well.</p>
